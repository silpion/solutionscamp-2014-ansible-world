Space **An Ansible World** on Silpion Solutionscamp 2014 by Mark Kusch.

## An [Ansible](https://ansible.com) World

Ansible is a young system to automate infrastructure based on the
*infrastructure in data* paradigm.


It features a low learning curve to get results quickly, is extremely
flexible and may get mis-used as *better shell scripting solution*.


Ansible does require SSH infrastructure only which makes it ideal to
automate distributable projects without forcing users to install
additional software/services.


When things are flexible there's a need to define some rules how to
work with such a tool, like a style guide or project integration.


One reason to decide for Ansible is the low learing curve, the target
to have more people automate the infrastructure, to enable project
DevOps teams for deep collaboration in terms of product **and**
infrastructure.


This session is about infrastructure automation with Ansible based
on projects rather than the complete infrastructure including test-driven
development of re-usable Ansible roles (mis)-using Docker.
